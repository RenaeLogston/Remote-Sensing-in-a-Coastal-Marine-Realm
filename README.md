Sentinel 3 data: Chl a, SST, Altimetry to examine False Bay, South Africa
I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Cape Town, South Africa.  My particular area of research is the coastal region of False Bay, South Africa.  I am particullary interested in the local forcings on the bay (wind, SST) on seasonal and event scale timeseries and how these forcings effect stratification, Chl a concentrations, currents and upwelling events in this region.  To examine this I have in situ instruments and I am also using MODIS Aqua and Sentinel 3 data sets.
